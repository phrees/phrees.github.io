I'm teaching myself Godot with a view to developing educational applications and games. In this blog I'm going to document my progress, describe the resources I find useful and share some code snippets. 

My first project is a tool to help teaching and learning of grapheme/phoneme mapping. It's aimed at older students and will be functional rather than entertaining.

The first approach I'm going to try is using Godot's UI features to represent graphemes and phonemes. I'll be attempting to populate a grid of buttons programatically.

Wish me luck.
